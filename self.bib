	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to investigate the neural correlates of cognition. fMRI non-invasively measures brain activity, allowing identification of patterns evoked by tasks performed during scanning. Despite the long history of this technique, the idiosyncrasies of each dataset have led to the use of ad-hoc preprocessing protocols customized for nearly every different study. This approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and unsuitable for combining datasets from many sources. Here we showcase fMRIPrep, a robust preprocessing tool for virtually any human BOLD (blood-oxygen level dependent) fMRI dataset that addresses the reproducibility concerns of the established protocols for fMRI preprocessing. Based on standardizations of the input and output data specifications, fMRIPrep is capable of preprocessing a diversity of datasets without manual intervention. In support of the growing popularity of fMRIPrep, this protocol describes how to integrate the tool in a task-based fMRI investigation workflow.},
